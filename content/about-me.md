My name is Olaf Alders. I develop software by day and (occasionally) by night.   My open source projects include [MetaCPAN.org](https://metacpan.org), as well as various [Perl modules](https://metacpan.org/author/OALDERS).  I have an M.A. in Classical Philology from McMaster University and an M.A. in Medieval Studies from the University of Toronto.  Sometimes [I also write and play music](http://vilerichard.com). 

In my free time, I ignore the Internet and spend time with my kids.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/oalders), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/olafalders) [LinkedIn](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/olafalders) or just [email me](mailto:olaf@wundersolutions.com).
