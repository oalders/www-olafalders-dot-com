Lots of exciting things have happened with
[MetaCPAN](http://www.metacpan.org/) since I posted the last update. The
most important development was the announcement that [Moritz Onken\'s
Google Summer of Code proposal for
MetaCPAN](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2011/mo/1)
was accepted. Moritz had already made a huge impact on MetaCPAN before
his proposal was accepted and this gives him even more time to devote to
improving both the front and back end of MetaCPAN.\
\
I\'ve always thought of this project as a marathon rather than a sprint,
but with the rate things have been happening lately, I may be forced to
re-evaluate. I\'d like to see us get the maximum benefit for the Summer
of Code grant. In order to do this, we still need some volunteers to dig
into [our big list of open
issues](https://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api/issues). The more issues we
can clear up, the more of his time Moritz can devote to some of the
meatier parts of his proposal, like module tagging, comments etc.\
\
So, if you\'re inclined to dig in and write some
code/tests/documentation or if you just want to give us a piece of your
mind, **please visit us at #metacpan on irc.perl.org**\
\
This project is still very fresh and malleable. We don\'t have years of
code to support or backward compatibility to care about. We can use all
the latest toys, break things and generally see what goes boom without
causing a lot of problems. Some of that will change when things go live,
but for the time being it\'s still the Wild West.\
\
Do you like writing tests? Do you want to write some interesting
Plack::Middleware? Do you want to work with
[ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/)? Do you want to work with
large, constantly changing data sets? We may just have something for
you.\
\
This is the sort of project upon which you can have an immediate impact.
You don\'t have to have years of experience with Perl. In fact, if
you\'re happy helping out with documentation or taking care of some
sysadmin tasks, that\'s equally needed help.\
\
The API which MetaCPAN will provide can be used to power command line
applications, web apps, mobile apps etc. It can be used as a back end
for a next generation CPAN search or even to host your own local,
searchable CPAN. It takes the unenviable task of breaking down what\'s
in the CPAN and makes all of that data available to you with just a few
REST API calls. If we do the right things, MetaCPAN will help to improve
a lot of tools which already exist and some which have yet to spring
into existence.\
\
That\'s my pitch for today. It won\'t be my last pitch, either. I\'m not
bashful about asking for help. If you\'re curious at all, join us on IRC
and we\'ll see if we can\'t find something interesting for you to do.
