I\'ll be speaking about [using (and abusing) the MetaCPAN API on day 2
of YAPC::NA](http://www.yapcna.org/yn2013/talk/4663). If you think you
might be attending (or even if you\'re not), I thought I\'d post some
links to some helpful info. No, you don\'t need to do any prep for this
talk, but for those who are interested, this is just some background
info that will help you get your head around MetaCPAN.\
\
This talk will touch on and expand on some of the points I discussed
last year, so you could have a quick look at [last year\'s
slides](http://www.slideshare.net/oalders/abusing-the-metacpan-api-for-fun-and-profit).
I\'ve also put together [some sample
code](https://github.com/CPAN-API/metacpan-examples) for tomorrow\'s
talk. If you use [Carton](https://metacpan.org/module/Carton), you can
follow the instructions in the top-level README to get started in just a
couple of minutes.\
\
On a barely related note, [iCPAN 2.1.0 is now in the app
store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/icpan/id377340561?mt=8). I used
it on the flight down to prepare for my talk. Seemed to work well for my
purposes. :)
