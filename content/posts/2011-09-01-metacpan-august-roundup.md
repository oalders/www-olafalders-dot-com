August was another busy month for MetaCPAN, so I think a recap is in
order. I\'ll proceed chronologically.\
\
2011-08-01\
\
[Gabor Szabo](https://metacpan.org/author/SZABGAB) included MetaCPAN in
his first issue of the [Perl Weekly](http://perlweekly.com/). It\'s an
excellent aggregation of all Perl things blog and newsworthy. I can tell
you just from the time involved in a MetaCPAN recap that Gabor is
spending a huge amount of time on his weekly newsletters. I follow a lot
of blog posts, but I find his weekly recap helps me find interesting
stuff I may have missed.\
\
2011-08-03\
\
Have you every blown away a lot of data you didn\'t have a backup for? I
know I have. It was client data and it was ugly. A lot of us have been
there and precisely this happened to MetaCPAN. In our rush to get cool
features online, we put off taking snapshots of all the cool data Perl
hackers were adding to the system. On this particular day, [it came back
to bite
us](http://blogs.perl.org/users/olaf_alders/2011/08/metacpan-undergoes-unplanned-re-index.html).
So, what was effectively a hard reset forced us to re-evaluate, re-index
and put a proper backup strategy in effect. You could say our new slogan
is \"The New MetaCPAN: Now with Backups!\".\
\
If you added any info (author or +1) before Aug 3 and haven\'t logged in
since, you\'ll need to clear your MetaCPAN cookies, reauthenticate and
start from scratch. It\'s sub-optimal, to be sure, but lessons have been
learned, more hard disks have been installed and we\'re working on
sponsorship to get a second server online which we can fail over to.\
\
2011-08-04\
\
There had been some complaints about not being able to diff on MetaCPAN,
so on Aug 4th [Mo](https://metacpan.org/author/PERLER) put a little
something together to do just that. [It looks
great](https://metacpan.org/diff/release/BOBTFISH/Catalyst-Runtime-5.90001/BOBTFISH/Catalyst-Runtime-5.90002),
works well and may have been some small compensation for the events of
the previous day. :)\
\
On the same day [RJBS](https://metacpan.org/author/RJBS) announced that
his [advent calendars](http://advent.rjbs.manxome.org/2010/) now link to
MetaCPAN rather than search.cpan.org!\
\
2011-08-08\
\
On this day [SARTAK](https://metacpan.org/author/SARTAK) added wishlist
functionality to MetaCPAN. If you find the PayPal button too mercenary,
you may appreciate the wishlist as a way of letting others thank you for
your hard work. Log in to add this to your author profiles.\
\
2011-08-10\
\
On this day [YANICK](https://metacpan.org/author/YANICK) added
[klout.com](http://klout.com) to the author profiles.\
\
2011-08-16\
\
On this day [AYOUNG](https://metacpan.org/author/AYOUNG) added
[Ohloh.net](Ohloh.net) to author profiles and I added
[github-meets-cpan.com](http://www.github-meets-cpan.com/) to the
profiles as well.\
\
2011-08-17\
\
On this date mo gave a [MetaCPAN lightning
talk](https://github.com/CPAN-API/presentations/tree/master/yapc_eu_2011)
at YAPC::EU, complete with impressive graphics.\

\
\
2011-08-18\
\
On this day [DOHERTY](https://metacpan.org/author/DOHERTY) rebranded the
+1 to ++ to make it more Perlish and less Googlesque.\
\
2011-08-19\
\
This date marks the intial Github commit of
[wata\'s](https://github.com/wata) excellent [CPANHelper Chrome helper
extension](https://github.com/wata/CPANHelper). I\'ve been making use of
this extension every day and I can tell you it\'s very cool. I highly
recommend it. [Install it
now](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lmbbdfdngngmcjihfdbknndaoijmmlhe).\
\
On this date I also became aware that
[TOKUHIROM](https://metacpan.org/author/TOKUHIROM) is slated to give [a
MetaCPAN talk at YAPC::ASIA](http://yapcasia.org/2011/talk/28). Kudos to
him for submitting the proposal. He has done a lot of work with the API
and I hope he posts his slides. :)\
\
2011-08-22\
\
Around this date, I added links to Changelogs on MetaCPAN at the release
level. This was a much-requested feature.\
\
2011-08-23\
\
On this date Mo added [\"reverse dependency\"
listings](https://metacpan.org/requires/module/Modern::Perl).\
\
2011-08-24\
\
[VTI](https://metacpan.org/author/VTI) came up with another gem on Aug
24th. [PerlResume.org](http://perlresume.org/) is an excellent example
of the kind of cool stuff you can do with the MetaCPAN API. Look
yourself up and see how your Perl Résumé stacks up against those of
other authors.\
\
2011-08-29\
\
Around this time I became aware of the fact that [p3rl.org](p3rl.org)
now points at MetaCPAN. Try it: <http://p3rl.org/shit>\
\
August also marks the wrap-up for Mo\'s Google Summer of Code project,
which was a huge success. Over the coming weeks we\'ll be putting a road
map together, to make plans for going forward without the same GSoC
resources at our disposal. We\'ve got a really solid foundation to work
on going forward, so we\'re feeling quite good about how the project is
progressing.\
\
In other news, we\'re working to bring a new sponsor on board this week
and I\'ll have an update on that once that has been set up.\
\
My apologies to any contributions I may have inadvertently missed in
this roundup. It wasn\'t intentional.\
