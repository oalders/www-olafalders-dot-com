In my previous post, I talked about [using Ale with vim for linting and syntax checking][1]. Since that time, the Ale defaults for Perl have changed. Perl::Critic checks are still on by default, but you will need to enable the syntax and compile checks that are run via the \`perl\` binary itself.

The reasoning for the new default is described [in the Ale docs][2]. If you want to (re-)enable your Perl checks, you can follow [the example in my dot files][3].
