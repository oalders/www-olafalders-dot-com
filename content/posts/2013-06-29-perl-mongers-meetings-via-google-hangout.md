This past Thursday we tried something new at Toronto.pm We decided to
try having our in-person meeting also available online via Google
Hangout. So far all feedback has been positive and it allowed us to have
a meeting of 15 people rather than just the 10 who made the trip to our
usual location. We had participants from as far as Texas and Alberta as
well as some local mongers who weren\'t able to make it to the location
but were still interested in the topic being presented.\
\
We\'re going to make a few tweaks to the setup in the actual meeting
room in order to let the online participants better hear the questions
asked in the room and vice versa, but moving forward it looks like
we\'re going to stick with this format and likely publicize the hangouts
so that just anyone can check in and participate. At least one of our
lightning talks in our coming September meeting will be from a remote
participant, which seems like a great way to get access to more speakers
than the usual suspects who attend our meetings in person.\
\
If you\'ve toyed with the idea of broadcasting your meetings, this may
also be a good solution for your local monger group.

  I believe allowing anyone to participate by publicizing the hangout that you mentioned as being planned is actually the very point of organizing an online meeting.
