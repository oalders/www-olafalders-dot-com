You may have already [seen the
news](http://news.perlfoundation.org/2014/12/3-perl-interns-accepted-for-th.html).
The latest round of [GNOME\'s Outreach Program for
Women](http://gnome.org/opw/) is now underway.\
\
I will have the pleasure of acting as a mentor for [Rose
Ames](https://github.com/rose) and [Andreea
Pirvulescu](https://github.com/andreeap). My main responsibility is to
make sure they have no significant blockers, so CPAN authors, don\'t be
surprised if I reach out to you on their behalf at some point. They\'ll
both be blogging about what they\'re up to, so feel free to follow
[Rose\'s blog](http://rose.github.io/rss.xml) and [Andreea\'s
blog](https://andreeapirvulescu.wordpress.com) to keep up on the latest
news from them.

  Thank you for doing this again Olaf. It reflects well on Perl that we have things like this happening in our big projects.
