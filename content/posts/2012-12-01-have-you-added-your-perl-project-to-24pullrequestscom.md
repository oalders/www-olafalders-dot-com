[24pullrequests.com](http://24pullrequests.com) takes the spirit of the
Advent coding calendar and puts a new spin on it. Try to send one pull
request per day for the next 24 days and 24pullrequests.com will help
you track your progress. At the time of writing, 1,224 devs have already
signed up.\
\
[Some Perl projects](http://24pullrequests.com/projects) are already
represented, but there\'s still room for more. It would be good to see
some more Perl projects on the list for participating Perl devs who are
looking for something to contribute to.
