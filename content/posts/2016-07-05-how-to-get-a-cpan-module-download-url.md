Every so often you find yourself requiring the download URL for a CPAN module. You can use the MetaCPAN API to do this quite easily, but depending on your use case, you may not be able to do this in a single query. Well, that's actually not entirely true. Now that we have v1 of the MetaCPAN API deployed, you can test out the shiny new (experimental) **download_url** endpoint. This was an endpoint added by [Clinton Gormley][1] at the QA Hackathon in Berlin. Its primary purpose is to make it easy for an app like [cpanm][2] to figure out which archive to download when a module needs to be installed. <del datetime="2016-07-06T14:38:21+00:00">[MetaCPAN::Client](https://metacpan.org/pod/MetaCPAN::Client) doesn't support this new endpoint yet, but</del> if you want to take advantage of it, it's pretty easy.

<pre>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature qw( say );

use Cpanel::JSON::XS qw( decode_json );
use LWP::UserAgent;
use URI::FromHash qw( uri );

my $module = shift @ARGV;

my $ua  = LWP::UserAgent->new;
my $uri = uri(
    scheme => 'https',
    host   => 'fastapi.metacpan.org',
    path   => '/v1/download_url/' . $module,
);

my $res = $ua->get($uri);
say decode_json( $res->decoded_content )->{download_url};
</pre>

Now invoke your script:

`<br />
olaf$ perl download_url.pl Plack<br />
https://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/M/MI/MIYAGAWA/Plack-1.0039.tar.gz<br />
` 

## Update!

After I originally wrote this post, [MICKEY][3] stepped up and actually added the functionality to [MetaCPAN::Client][4]. A huge thank you to him for doing this. ðŸ™‚ Let's try this again:

<pre>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature qw( say );

use MetaCPAN::Client 1.018000;
my $mcpan = MetaCPAN::Client->new( version => 'v1' );

my $module = shift @ARGV;

say $mcpan->download_url( $module )->download_url;
</pre>

That cuts the lines of code almost in half and is less error prone than crafting the query ourselves. I'd encourage you to use [MetaCPAN::Client][4] unless you have a compelling reason not to.

## Caveats

This endpoint is experimental. Â It might not do what you want in all cases. Â See [this GitHub issue][5] for reference. Â Please add to this issue if you find more cases which need to be addressed. Â Having said that, this endpoint should do the right thing for most cases. Â Feel free to play with it to see if it suits your needs.
