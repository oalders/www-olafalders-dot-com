We\'ve been doing a lot of work behind the scenes on MetaCPAN lately and
we\'ve come to the realization that we needed some private repository
hosting. In the past, we\'ve reached out to companies where we had
contacts, and [they\'ve been happy to
help](https://metacpan.org/about/sponsors). Last night, [I wondered if
anyone on Twitter would be able to help us
out](https://twitter.com/wundercounter/status/441427258264141825). That
was at 11:17 PM EST. By 12:27 AM [Johannes Plunien had forwarded my
request to a real, live
GitHubber](https://twitter.com/plutooth/status/441444904645197824) and
by 9:32 AM we had our Github-sponsored account. It probably would have
happened even faster if I hadn\'t indulged in sleep last night.\
\
A few different things make me happy here.\
\

1.  [Johannes Plunien](https://twitter.com/plutooth) was able to connect
    us with a GitHub employee within the hour of this very public
    request
2.  [Mike Adolphs](https://twitter.com/fooforge) at GitHub was extremely
    responsive to our request
3.  [GitHub](https://github.com/) has chosen to support MetaCPAN and the
    Perl community in this way
4.  While all of this was going on, I was privately contacted by another
    person who said that if GitHub didn\'t make it happen, his company
    could look into picking up the tab for the account

\
\
Since we don\'t have a budget for MetaCPAN, we remain online because of
services donated to us by companies which are friendly to the Perl
community. If you have a look at [our sponsors
page](https://metacpan.org/about/sponsors), you\'ll see how many
companies are involved in keeping MetaCPAN online. We\'re very grateful
to all of our sponsors, past and present. So, I felt like it was time to
begin thanking our sponsors more publicly. As MetaCPAN continues to
grow, we\'ll continue to need sponsorships. We couldn\'t survive without
them.
