Lots of great stuff is happening with MetaCPAN. Here\'s a quick (and
incomplete) list.\
\
First off, Yanick Champoux has been doing some excellent work to add
module up and downvoting to the [MetaCPAN
API](https://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api). [His work is on
Github](https://github.com/yanick/cpanvote) He has also [created a
Greasemonkey
script](https://github.com/yanick/cpanvote/raw/master/greasemonkey/cpan_vote.user.js)
to allow module voting to begin on search.cpan.org. We plan on
incorporating it into the
[cpan-mangler](https://github.com/oalders/cpan-mangler) as well, so that
you can vote on search.cpan.org without needing GreaseMonkey.\
\
Yanick\'s work will pave the way for module commenting, bookmarking etc.
The great thing about this is that we\'ll be able to collect data on
most loved and hated modules/distributions without being tied into any
one particular search site or application. This is the sort of data
which can make getting an overview of CPAN much easier. Yanick will
likely post about his work in greater detail, but it\'s pretty cool
stuff. It could change how you approach your search for new modules.\
\
Secondly, Shlomi Fish took the initiative and started a #metacpan
channel on irc.freenode.net Please stop in for a chat. We\'d like to
hear your ideas and, even better, we\'d love to hear from anyone who
would like to contribute. If you\'ve never been involved in an open
source project, this is a project which could use your help. There are
lots of directions to move in, fun toys to play with and many ways which
you can make an impression on the project. That\'s not to say that the
old and the grizzled aren\'t welcome \-- they certainly are as well!\
\
Thirdly, some bug fixes from MetaCPAN have been backported to
[iCPAN](https://github.com/oalders/iCPAN). An updated app should be sent
to Apple for approval in the next couple of weeks.\
\
Lastly, we\'re still looking to get greater coverage of CPAN authors in
our index. If you haven\'t [forked our project and added yourself to the
list](http://blogs.perl.org/users/olaf_alders/2010/12/expanding-your-author-info-in-the-metacpan.html),
please do so. It takes about 10 minutes.

  Keep up the awesome work! We've needed this fresh approach to CPAN for sometime.
