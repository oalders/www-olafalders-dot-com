For the third year running, we have the privilege of working out of the ServerCentral offices in downtown Chicago in order to hack on [MetaCPAN][1]. This year, five of us will be working on improving our corner of the Perl ecosystem. The physical attendee list is follows:

  * Doug Bell
  * Joel Berger
  * Olaf Alders
  * Mickey Nasriachi
  * Shawn Sorichetti

This, of course, would not be possible without the help of our 2018 sponsors: [Booking.com][2] and [ServerCentral][3]. You'll notice their logos on the front page of MetaCPAN into 2019 as our way of thanking them for their support.

I'd like briefly to revisit last year's event, which was quite productive and would not have happened without our 2017 sponsors:

  * [Booking.com][2]
  * [Cpanel.com][4]
  * [ServerCentral][3]
  * [Kritika.IO][5]

In 2017, we made excellent progress on various fronts. Part of this progress came via an onsite visit from [Panopta][6], our monitoring sponsor. They have a Chicago office and were very responsive when I asked them if they'd be willing to send someone down to chat with us about improving our [Panopta][6] configuration. So, Shabbir kindly dropped by, giving us in-person advice on how to configure our [Panopta][6] monitoring. One of the most helpful tweaks was setting up an IRC integration, so that outages are now broadcast to #metacpan on irc.perl.org.

Here's a photo of Shabbir's visit. (I wasn't able to attend in person last year, but I was able to do so remotely. I'm the one watching from the wall.)

I'll post more about our progress over the next few days. We're working on some fixes and something new and shiny too. Wish us luck!
