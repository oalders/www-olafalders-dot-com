As you may know [MetaCPAN](https://metacpan.org) as a project has no
budget. We rarely solicit funds because we rarely need to pay for
anything. This has allowed us to focus on the project itself rather than
the administrative issues that arise whenever money changes hands.
Because these relationships allow us the freedom to do what we need to
do, we think it\'s important to thank [our
sponsors](https://metacpan.org/about/sponsors) publicly.\
\
And with that introduction I\'d like to thank
[Panopta](http://www.panopta.com/), the latest sponsor in the MetaCPAN
world.\
\
A while back I put out a call on Twitter to see about getting someone to
sponsor a monitoring solution. Less than 30 minutes later, I got a
response directly from Panopta. I started an email conversation and we
had a sponsored account in no time.\
\
Panopta is like other hosted monitoring solutions in that you can do
ping (and other) checks of your services and you get email notifications
when things go sideways. However, what we find really useful is that
Panopta makes it trivial to install their agents on your servers as
well. You can manage the internal checks that these local agents handle
via the Panopta web interface. You then get the same level of
notifications you would get for your external checks. So, you not only
have a hosted monitoring service to check your public facing ports, but
you can add checks for disk space, CPU and internal processes to your
heart\'s content. This is not a knock against \[insert your favourite
open source monitoring solution here\]. It\'s just that our stack is
already pretty big and complicated and this allows us to take at least
one layer out of it, for which we\'re very grateful.\
\
The technical support I\'ve asked for from Panopta has always been
lightning fast and uptime has been amazing, so it has been working very
well for us. I also appreciate their patience, since I\'ve wanted to
thank them publicly for some time now. :)\
\
As an addendum, there are more sponsor acknowledgements coming. I\'ve
gotten behind on these and I\'m posting them in chronological order.
It\'s a good problem to have, though!
