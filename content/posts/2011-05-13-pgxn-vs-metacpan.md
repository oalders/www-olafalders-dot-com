David E. Wheeler has done some great work with [PGXN](http://pgxn.org/).
It\'s an excellent example of how you can build something CPAN-like
without being weighed down with design decisions from long ago. There\'s
JSON all over the place and there are mashups just waiting to happen.\
\
In his latest post, [he has challenged
MetaCPAN](http://blog.pgxn.org/post/5441748625/jsonp-callbacks) to
duplicate some of the shiny, new PGXN functionality. Turns out we can do
shiny things too. [This solution](https://gist.github.com/970366) uses a
combination of our current (older) API and our (newer) beta front end.\
\
To see the JS and HTML output in action, [check out this
fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/N7E6S/), [this even cleaner
fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/wundersolutions/kFvS4/29/) or [this jQuery
solution](http://jsfiddle.net/kFvS4/20/). Take that, PGXN! :)

  His post is all nice and friendly sounding, but you should have heard Olaf at the office going "Nyah nyah PGXN take that!".

  The <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/kFvS4/5/">second Fiddle</a> no longer shows results. :-(
