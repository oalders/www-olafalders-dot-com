It's pretty frustrating to send a pull request on GitHub only to have your contribution languish for weeks, months or even years. One way to avoid this is to contact the maintainer before you do the heavy lifting. What can also help is just to take a quick look at a repository, to see how actively maintained it actually is. Because GitHub prefers showing you open issues over closed ones, this can sometimes be a bit misleading. A project with 25 open pull requests (hereafter referred to as <i>PRs</i>) Â may seem like it's unmaintained, but if 1,000 have already been merged, then the remaining 25 are just a small percentage of what has already been submitted.

After having been annoyed by some of my contributions being ignored, I figured I'd write a little tool to help me get a quick overview of what is going on in a GitHub repository. Enter [github-mergevelocity][1]. This is a command line tool which aggregates pull request data for one or more repositories and spits out a few stats to the screen. For example, earlier today I was looking at a repository which looked to be unloved. It has one pull request which had been open for 4 years without a single comment. I decided to dig a bit deeper. Here's what I got. Author and repo names have been redacted:

```
olaf$ github-mergevelocity --url https://github.com/[USERNAME]/[REPOSITORY]
.------------+--------------------+----------+-----+---------+------------+---------+-------------+---------+---------------.
| user       | repo               | velocity | PRs | merged  | merge days | closed  | close days  | open    | open days     |
+------------+--------------------+----------+-----+---------+------------+---------+-------------+---------+---------------+
| [USERNAME] | [REPOSITORY]       | -279     | 13  | 38% (5) | 2/PR (9)   | 15% (2) | 79/PR (157) | 46% (6) | 861/PR (5164) |
'------------+--------------------+----------+-----+---------+------------+---------+-------------+---------+---------------'
```

Let's ignore the first three columns for now. Let's break down the rest.

### PRs

The total number of pull requests that we know about. In this case it's 13.

### merged

5 (or 38%) of these pull requests have already been merged.

### merge days

In total it took about 9 days to merge the 5 pull requests. That's a rounded average of about 2 days per request (which is very good).

### closed

2 (or 15%) of the pull requests were closed without being merged. We don't know from this if the commits were merged outside of the original PR, though.

### close days

In total it took about 157 days to close the 2 pull requests. That's a rounded average of about 79 days (almost 3 months) per request.

### open

The remaining 6 PRs represent 46% of the total PRs.

### open days

These 6 open PRs have been open for a combined 5,164 days or 861 days on average per request.

### What Have We Learned?

My big takeaway from this, without looking at the PRs, is that if this maintainer intends to merge your PR, it will probably be done in a timely manner. Otherwise, expect to wait for months or years.

That's overly simplified. We don't know if the maintainer was initially quite fast at merges and then life happened. We don't know if the merged PRs were sent by the maintainer or co-workers or what the motivations were at all, but we do know that there's a good chance our work won't be making it into the master branch anytime soon.

So, take that with a grain of salt. Having said that, it can be fun to run this script against your own repositories and/or those of friends and co-workers or even GitHub organizations. Let's try that now.

```
olaf$ github-mergevelocity --url neilb/PAUSE-Permissions --url oalders/HTTP-BrowserDetect --url plack/Plack --url moose/Moose --url libwww-perl/WWW-Mechanize
.-------------+--------------------+----------+-----+----------+---------------+----------+---------------+----------+-----------------.
| user        | repo               | velocity | PRs | merged   | merge days    | closed   | close days    | open     | open days       |
+-------------+--------------------+----------+-----+----------+---------------+----------+---------------+----------+-----------------+

'-------------+--------------------+----------+-----+----------+---------------+----------+---------------+----------+-----------------'
```

### What Have We Learned?

First, no need to provide the full URL if you don't want to. [username]/[repository_name] is enough. Secondly, the **velocity** column now makes sense. It's just an arbitrary score assigned to a repository, based on the what we know about the state of the pull requests. The results are sorted in order of highest velocity to lowest.

The repository with the most velocity is one of mine. I can assure that I chose well in order present myself in the best possible light! The one open pull request is an added test case that I haven't figured out what to do with yet.

Next, we see that while [Moose][2] and [Plack][3] are busy projects, they are both quite fast at dealing with PRs. Also, it becomes clear that we're only looking at the last 100 PRs, since that's what GitHub gives us and we're not paginating through results.

After that we have [PAUSE::Permissions][4], which is a [NEILB][5] module. I was hoping to make some kind of comment like **Getting Neil Bowers to merge your PRs is the _real_ [Pull Request Challenge][6]**, but he's doing well here, so can't push his buttons this time.

Last on the list and the only repo with a negative velocity is [WWW::Mechanize][7]. As it stands, things are progressing very slowly with WWW::Mechanize, but it's not a lost cause. It just needs some love. I'll address this in a following blog post. 

A couple of other things to note.

## Debugging

If you want to see the API calls which this script makes in real time, use the `--debug-useragent` flag.

```
olaf$ github-mergevelocity --url neilb/PAUSE-Permissions --debug-useragent 6
GET https://api.github.com/repos/neilb/PAUSE-Permissions/pulls

GET Params:

To do this, we're using [LWP::ConsoleLogger::Easy][8]. Its verbosity ranges from 1-8. For instance, if you want to see the actual JSON, bump it up to 7. I won't paste it here, as it's a bit much.

## Caching

You can also use `--cache-requests` to turn on request caching. This speeds things up a lot and can help you out with GitHub's rate limiting.

## Authentication

You can also pass a GitHub username and token to the script, which has the advantage of a much more generous rate limit. Run the script without any args for more details on this.
