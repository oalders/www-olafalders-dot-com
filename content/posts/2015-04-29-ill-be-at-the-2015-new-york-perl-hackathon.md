I'm happy to say that I'll be participating in the [2015 New York Perl Hackathon](http://blogs.perl.org/users/itcharlie/2015/03/new-york-city-perl-hackathon-2015.html). I'd like to thank Bloomberg, L.P. for sponsoring me so that I can attend this event.

While I'm at the hackathon, I hope to continue my work on MetaCPAN as I did at the QA Hackathon one week ago. I've put together [a list of possible MetaCPAN projects](https://github.com/nyperlmongers/nyperlhackathon2015/wiki/MetaCPAN-Hacking). If anyone would like to take on any of these projects, feel free to get in touch with me in advance if you have any questions on what might be involved with any of these proposals.

I'll also be available to help out with things which aren't MetaCPAN-related: Perl, Git, GitHub, etc. There's more general information at the [hackathon wiki](https://github.com/nyperlmongers/nyperlhackathon2015/wiki).

I will, of course, report back on my progress at the hackathon after the event has taken place. I'm looking forward to a productive day of hacking with a group of smart, motivated people.
