I was quite happy to see [Samuel Kaufman\'s
post](http://blogs.perl.org/users/samuel_kaufman/2013/09/howto-youtube-live-streaming-of-a-talk.html)
on how to stream your local PM/whatever meetings. We\'ve been
experimenting with streaming our Toronto.pm meetings for the past few
months. [Last night we had our annual September lightning
talks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaIbUzWJwB8) and I feel like we
finally got it right \-- or at least we\'re getting very close. We had a
laptop set up at the front of the room. Each speaker used this laptop
and a USB key with their talk on it. That laptop was hosting a Google
\"On Air\" Hangout and also provided a mic for the speaker and the room.
We also had a pair of powered speakers connected to the laptop so that
we could hear the hangout participants who were remote. It\'s not
perfect, but it\'s working well for us.\
\
The really interesting part of it was that, for the first time, one of
the talks was given remotely by a hangout participant. (Abram Hindle\'s
\"Iteration in Perl\"). The significance of this is that we can a) now
share our meetings with the world in real time and b) invite guest
speakers to share their ideas with us remotely. The meetings are also
archived, so you can find them on Youtube once the meeting is over.\
\
Toronto.pm has been active for many years, so I\'ve always figured it
was the norm to have easy access to monthly technical meetings. However,
I\'ve come to realize that even cities with populations in the millions
may not have an active mongers group. So, there are likely quite a few
developers out there who would be interested in hearing (or giving) the
odd talk via Hangout. We\'re planning to do this monthly, going forward,
except for the odd month (like December) when the meeting is purely
social.\
\
If you\'re interested in attending a meeting (either in person or
virtually), [please join our meetup
group](http://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Perl-Mongers/) so that you\'ll be
notified in advance of dates and topics. If you\'re interested in last
night\'s meeting, [you\'ll find the video on
youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaIbUzWJwB8). The talks start at
the 2:00 minute mark:\
\
2:00 extend_cd (Tom Legrady)\
10:08 Metaphors We Code By (Stuart Watt)\
19:00 Code::TidyAll (Olaf Alders)\
33:30 Why the Universe is Like Lasagna (Alan Rocker)\
40:00 Iteration in Perl (Abram Hindle)\
57:50 Design Diagnostics (Mike Stok)\
