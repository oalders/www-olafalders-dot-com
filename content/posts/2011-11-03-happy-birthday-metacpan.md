It was exactly 1 year ago today (Nov 3, 2010) that I registered the
[metacpan.org](https://metacpan.org) domain name. Over the course of
this year, the project has gone from a couple of guys writing some code
to [a true community effort](https://metacpan.org/about/contributors).
MetaCPAN is steadily being adopted by Perl developers around the globe
and it is steadily gaining in functionality.\
\
Together we\'ve created a free, open, collaborative project which makes
new tools available to CPAN lovers everywhere. The API has spawned some
cool and very useful projects. The web site has spawned some much needed
functionality in the form of diffs, syntax highlighting, author profiles
etc.\
\
What you may not know is that MetaCPAN is now set up in such a way that
all resources (servers, DNS, email, domain registration, etc) can be
configured by a handful of core devs. This means that if any one (or
several) core devs drop out of the picture, the project can continue on
as before. There is no one person who can act as a blocker to the rest
of the contributors and anything which might be considered controversial
requires consensus before it gets pushed to the master branch. So far, I
think this has yielded good results.\
\
For example, here\'s the latest roundup, which **does not include
numerous bug fixes and other tweaks by
[PERLER](https://metacpan.org/author/PERLER), among others**:\
\
Sept 6: [PLU](https://metacpan.org/author/PLU) adds [a contributors

  This is a good opportunity to mention how much you rock! Seriously.

MetaCPAN has shown it's greatness, IMHO, by bringing all these kickass people out of the woodworks, and having them work and build together this amazing ecosystem that interacts so well.

I can't think of so many projects that got people to just volunteer themselves and build new stuff around it, while feeling right at home, ya know?

Kind of hard to explain, but to anyone who's been working on projects of and within a community, MetaCPAN is a glaring example of how to do things right. It's this formula we can't really explain in so many words, but MetaCPAN definitely got it nailed!

Kudos to **everyone** involved!! :)

  That's a glowing review! Thanks very much -- it's great to hear.  :)  Of course, the Dancer community is an excellent template for a lot of people coming together to create something truly great.  It's amazing how much people can get done when they just generally have a good attitude.
