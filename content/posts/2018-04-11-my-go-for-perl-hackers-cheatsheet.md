Last year I found myself working on some Go code at $work. When I'm trying to pick up constructs in a new language, I find it helpful to see how I would have done the same things in Perl. This sheet is far from complete, but I think it's already helpful. You can find it at <https://github.com/oalders/go-for-perl-hackers>. Comments, critique and pull requests are welcome. I've already had some helpful feedback via Twitter which I've incorporated.

As an aside, I did this a long back for [Objective-C][1].
