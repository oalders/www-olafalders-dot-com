The MetaCPAN project would like officially to welcome our summer of 2014
Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and Outreach Program for Women (OPfW)
participants. We had a lot of interest this time around and some great
applications. Our OPfW participant is [Pattawan
Kaewduangdee](https://github.com/oiami) and our GSoC student is [Talina
Shrotriya](https://github.com/talina06). Both Talina and Pattawan have
plans to make some much needed improvements to MetaCPAN and we\'re
really looking forward to working with them. I\'ve linked to both of
their Github profiles above in case you want to track their progress
commit by commit.\
\
I\'d also like to thank the Perl Foundation for its support in both of
these programs. Lately I\'ve had a chance to glimpse how much work goes
on behind the scenes to make these sorts of programs happen and I can
tell you it\'s impressive to see how much volunteer work is involved in
something like this.

  This is good for Perl, and good for the image of Perl. You mentioned the work behind the scenes of the Perl Foundation, but I've also seen your work behind the scenes to make this happen. Thank you for doing this, and thank you to the others on the MetaCPAN team who will be supporting Pattawan and Talina.

And good luck to Pattawan and Talina!

  Since there are big chucks of metacpan written in Catalyst I would love to here about:

1) If any of the new features in Catalyst added since Metacpan went live are useful and

2) What Catalyst pain points do our students hit?

I'd love that to inform the work on future Catalyst goals.

  Thanks for your kind words, Neil.  It means a lot coming from someone who does as much behind the scenes as you do.  :)

  Those are very good points to cover and maybe the subject of a future blog post.  I can ask Talina and Pattawan to keep these questions in mind while coding.

On that note, since MetaCPAN is open source, I suppose it could serve as a sort of example for anyone wanting to write a Catalyst application.   If you know of anyone who is willing to audit the code to see where we may not be following best practices, that would be helpful to us and to anyone who might look to the source code to get an idea of how a Catalyst app works.
