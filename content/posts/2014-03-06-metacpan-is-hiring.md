OK, so that\'s maybe not 100% accurate, but we **are** looking for
students who want to get paid to work with us. How can you get paid to
work on MetaCPAN? There are currently two really great options: the
[Outreach Program for
Women](http://www.perlfoundation.org/outreach_program_for_women) (OPfW)
and the [Google Summer of
Code](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2014)
(GSoC).\
\
What MetaCPAN needs from you is to help spread the word to interested
students who may want to participate. Here\'s the pitch:\
\
*There are lots of things you can learn by working on the MetaCPAN
stack. Our stack includes Catalyst, Plack, ElasticSearch, jQuery,
Bootstrap and nginx. We also use Puppet for deployment and Vagrant +
VirtualBox for development VMs. We have integration with Twitter,
Github, PAUSE, Facebook and Google.\
\
You will have help and guidance in working with these technologies from
people who are quite familiar with them. Your code will deploy on robust
hardware (think 30+ GB of RAM). Your code will often deploy within hours
or even minutes of being submitted. Your work will immediately be put to
the test by our many users on our very busy services. You\'ll gain
experience in NoSQL (ElasticSearch), git, and also in participating in
an Open Source project which functions as a highly available web
service. You will gain experience not just in writing code, but in
participating in the full cycle of code deployment, skills which are
quite valuable in the real world.\
\
More info on how to get involved is listed on [our development
page](https://metacpan.org/about/development).*\
\
Maybe you\'re thinking \"So, get to the important stuff already. How
much does it pay?\"\
\
Well, OPfW pays \$5,500 and I\'m under the impression that GSoC will pay
the same amount this year. Both programs are being run in parallel. If
your gender identification is in line with [the requirements of
OPfW](https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen) then you are
actually encouraged to apply for **both** programs. The important thing
to remember is that, at the end of the day, gender will not limit you
from participating. There\'s a program for everybody.\
\
The deadlines for both programs are rapidly approaching. OPfW has an
application deadline of March 19, 2014 and [GSoC has an application
window of March 10 -
21](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2014) (Don\'t
be fooled if the Google page appears to be blank at the top. Someone
should get a GSoC slot just to fix the google-melange site).\
\
However, please, don\'t take my word for anything. Do go to the
respective sites to double check dates, requirements etc.\
\
Essentially what you need to in order to be able to apply for either of
these programs is to get involved in the MetaCPAN project. Send us your
resume/CV so that we can get to know you a little better. Then, with our
guidance, you can start shipping some code. (This is actually quite
easy). Once you\'ve become formally involved with the project, we can
work with you on your application. There\'s not a lot of time, though,
so let\'s get started on those pull requests!\
\
We want students to leave this experience with some real world skills,
but we\'d also like for students to love the project so much that they
continue contributing after this summer. We have lots of interesting
problems to solve. Please help us find the right students to continue
moving MetaCPAN forward. If you know someone who might be interested,
please share this link.\
\
My contact info is listed at <https://metacpan.org/author/OALDERS>, but
essentially anyone can get help getting started by joining #metacpan on
irc.perl.org and just asking for help. The channel is very friendly and
there\'s generally someone around who can offer some guidance.
