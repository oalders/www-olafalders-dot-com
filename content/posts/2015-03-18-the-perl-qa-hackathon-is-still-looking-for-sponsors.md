Last year I shared an article about how [You Can Help MetaCPAN by
Helping the QA
Hackathon](http://blogs.perl.org/users/olaf_alders/2014/03/you-can-help-metacpan-by-helping-the-qa-hackathon.html).
A year later, you can still help MetaCPAN by [helping the QA
Hackathon](http://act.qa-hackathon.org/qa2015/sponsors.html). As one of
the core MetaCPAN developers, I\'m planning to attend this event next
month. It\'s still the best chance that I get to sit down and focus on
MetaCPAN. MetaCPAN has had the good fortune of having multiple interns
working on code since the Hackathon last year and we\'ve made a lot of
headway, but there\'s a lot of heavy lifting which still needs to be
done, particularly around how we use Elasticsearch. This is also a good
chance for me to be in the same room with folks who work on the
toolchain and to get a better feel for how MetaCPAN can help them.\
\
Just to summarize the much more eloquent posts which have preceded mine,
Mr. Neil Bowers of **White Camel** fame shared [a very good summary of
what goes on at a QA
Hackathon](http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2015/01/the-perl-qa-hackathon-2015.html).\
\
In addition to this David Farrell wrote an excellent piece on [why the
QA Hackathon is a unique
event](http://perltricks.com/article/147/2015/1/28/Support-the-2015-QA-Hackathon).
(He even had the good taste to feature some truly handsome devils right
at the top).\
\
The QA Hackathon is probably not widely well understood, but these
articles do well to explain what this event is and why it\'s important.
Please take 10 minutes out of your day and give them a read if you\'re
hazy on why this event is sponsor money well spent.\
\
Individuals may [donate directly via the QA Hackathon
site](http://act.qa-hackathon.org/qa2015/donate.html) (scroll to the
bottom). However, if you know of a potential corporate sponsor (or are a
potential sponsor), please get in touch with me so that someone on the
fundraising team can go over the sponsorship options with them. [My
contact info is easy to find on
MetaCPAN](https://metacpan.org/author/OALDERS).
